Computer Vision, a dynamic subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the real world. One of the fascinating applications within this domain is the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation. 
A GAN consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. These networks are trained simultaneously through a process of adversarial competition. The generator creates new data samples, while the discriminator evaluates them against real data. The generator aims to produce samples indistinguishable from real data, whereas the discriminator strives to accurately differentiate between real and generated samples. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces highly realistic images, fooling the discriminator consistently.
